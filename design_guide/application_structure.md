# Application structure

## App bar
The app bar should be present in every screen of the app so that the user can easily navigate around in the app.
The app bar that should always be used is the GirafAppBar which is a widget that is implemented in the weekplanner flutter project and includes all the buttons that should be present on the app bar.

## Bottom bar
Bottom bars must be entirely contextual and depend on the current content displayed in the current activity. The bottom bar should always styled similar to the app bar with the same color.

## Content
The main content of applications should be focused in the center of the layout and any menu bars
should be above, under, and to the sides of the main content.

The layout should utilize widgets to achieve the desired layout.

## Item familiarity

It is important that the users are familiar with the items they are manipulating. One should make
sure that a given item looks the same when navigating, creating and editing.
