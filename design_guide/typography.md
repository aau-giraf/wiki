# Typography
All text in the system should be consistent in terms of font, sizes and colors.

## Text colors
All text should by default be black (see colors section of the design guide).
In case the text refers to an inactive element, the grey text color should be used.

## Font family
The font should always be from the Roboto family of fonts.

## Font size
Text should always use the default Flutter font size.

## Bold, italic and underlined text
The text should never be bold, italic or underlined in order to maintain a consistent design.
