# Ownership Transfer

This document will describe how the next generation of GIRAF developers can get
ownership of the different services.

## GIRAF Passwords

All relevant passwords should be found in the password manager [KeePass](https://keepass.info/).
Contact Ulrik Nyman ([ulrik@cs.aau.dk](mailto:ulrik@cs.aau.dk)) to get access to
the it. 

The manager works by loading a file (``Giraf_Logins.kdbx``) and using the master
password. 

Remember to have the file available some place public (eg. Drive) so all members
can get access if they need to. 
Any changes made means that the file will have to be re-uploaded. 
We recommend that the process group manages the passwords and the file.

## GitHub

To get access to the [GitHub](https://github.com/aau-giraf) repositories, an
owner needs to add the new members. 
Use the following credentials to login and add all the relevant members.

Username: ``giraf@lists.aau.dk``

Password: see [KeePass](#giraf-passwords)


## Google Play Store

To access the Google Play Store use the following credentials.

Email: ``aaugiraf@gmail.com``

Password: see [KeePass](#giraf-passwords)

## App Store

To access the App Store use the following credentials.

Email: ``giraf@lists.aau.dk``

Password: see [KeePass](#giraf-passwords)

## Google Drive

To access the Google Drive use the same credentials as for the [Google Play Store](#google-play-store).

Email: ``aaugiraf@gmail.com``

Password: see [KeePass](#giraf-passwords)

The Drive contains, among other things of interest, a dump of the Google Drive
used by GIRAF 2020F

## Server Access

The server-meta group must compile a list of student emails who needs sudo access
to the server. 
The list should be sent to [support@its.aau.dk](mailto:support.its.aau.dk) after
Semester Coordinater Ulrik Nyman ([ulrik@cs.aau.dk](mailto:ulrik@cs.aau.dk)) has
**approved** the list. 

More information can be found [here](../../development/Server/ServerOwnership.md#ownership-transfer)

### Portainer Access

Portainer allows the visualization of the structure for the docker images. 
It can be helpful to have an UI instead of working in a terminal. 
Note that you have to be on the AAU network or use the AAU VPN to access it.

URL: ```192.38.56.151:9000```

Username: ``admin``

Password: see [KeePass](#giraf-passwords)
