There was no release at the end of sprint 1 because we decided to change framework
from Xamarin to Flutter two weeks before the sprint ended. This meant that we
started from scratch and didn't have anything to release at the end of sprint 1.
The last part of sprint 1 was instead spent on getting familiar with the Flutter
framework, implementing some simple user stories and getting the core functionality
ready so that we could build an application around it.
