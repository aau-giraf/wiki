    - Citizens must be able to mark an activity as completed, using a variety of

      removing the activity from the view, and moving them to the right.
    - An activity can be marked as completed by accessing the activity page in
      citizen mode and pressing a button in this page.
    - **This release must include the option to checkmark an activity.**
- Marking an activity as cancelled (Task ~~[T1221](http://web.giraf.cs.aau.dk/T1221)~~)

    - An activity can be marked as cancelled by accessing the activity page in
      guardian mode, and pressing a button in this page.

      days or activities.
