# Overview 

This section of pages contains information useful to new developers starting development
on GIRAF. Some of it is made by the 2019 project groups.

It is recommended to read the latest years' advice first, since it builds upon the
previous years.

Another important section to read is the advice from the previous year (F2020).
It can be found in the [Archive](..\archive\2020\advice.md).
