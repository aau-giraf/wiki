# Overview

This section historically contained necessary information necessary to know before developing on the GIRAF projects. That information can now be found in the [Legacy](../Legacy/index.md) section for the curious. The exception is generally useful knowledge such as information regarding the Wiki and its upkeep.

We advise you check out the [GIRAF](https://github.com/aau-giraf) GitHub for the most recent development information.
