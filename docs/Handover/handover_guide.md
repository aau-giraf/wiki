# Handover Guide

This guide explains which sections that should be added or updated in the Wiki
whenever a GIRAF team is finished with a semester.

## New Sections

Here is a description of the new sections that had to be added to the Wiki.

### Main Handover

The placement of the main handover from a GIRAF team is illustrated below. The
three main things to include are:

- Description of role structure
- Description of sprint events
- Description of the tools that has been used (Scripts, Google Sheets etc.)

```bash
Handover
├── Handover Guide
├── Semester name                 # New section
│   ├── Role Structure            #    
│   ├── Sprint Events             #
│   └── Tools                     #      
│       ├── Process Group         #  
│       └── Other Tools           #  
├── ...
├── 2020E
├── 2020F
├── 2019
└── 2018       
```

**Semester name** is the year a semester is held e.g. 2020.
 
2020 is followed by E or F because GIRAF was worked on in both the Spring (F)
and Autumn (E) semester.

## Updated Sections

Here is a description of the sections that needs to be updated.

### Prototypes

The PO group should add links for the new prototype files.

```bash
UI_Design
└── Prototypes
    └── Overview    # File to update       
```

The newest entry should be the top most in the table shown in the overview.
