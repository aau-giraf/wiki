# Handover Guide

This guide explains, which sections that should be added or updated in the Wiki
whenever a GIRAF team is done on a semester.

## New Sections

Here is a description of the new sections that had to be added to the Wiki.

### Main Handover

The placement of the main handover from a GIRAF team is illustrated below. The
three main things to include are:

- Description of role structure
- Description of sprint events
- Description of the tools that has been used (Scripts, Google Sheets etc.)

```bash

├── ...
├── 2020E
├── 2020F
├── 2019
└── 2018       
```

**Semester name** is the year a semester is held e.g. 2020.
 
2020 is followed by E or F because GIRAF team was worked on in both the Spring (F)
and Autumn (E) semester.
