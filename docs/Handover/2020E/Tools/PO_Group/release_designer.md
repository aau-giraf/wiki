# Release designer

To fetch the issues from GitHub which have been completed in a release, the [Issue Table Generator](https://github.com/dkalaxdk/IssueTableGenerator) was used to fetch the relevant issues and make them into a markdown or LaTeX table.
A guide on how to use it can be seen on the GitHub repository.
