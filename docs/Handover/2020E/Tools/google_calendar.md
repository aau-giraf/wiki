# Google Calendar

In order to keep everyone on the GIRAF team updated on when and where 
the different Sprint events took place there was made a shared 
Google Calendar for the whole GIRAF team.

This calendar was used to track:

- Sprint events
- Supervisor meetings
- Courses

The calendar was also connected to a channel on slack. On this channel 
there would be daily updates at 8:00 in the morning showing what happened that day.
