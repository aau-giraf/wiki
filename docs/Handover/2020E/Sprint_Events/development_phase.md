# Development Phase

The Development Phase starts after the Sprint Planning and ends on the day
of the Sprint Review.

## Work with Issues

In the Development Phase, the Development teams work with the issues they have
been given by the Process group after the Sprint Planning. 

### Need More Issues to Work On

If you have time to work on a additional issues, than the ones that were
distributed after Sprint Planning, you can get a new one by following
these steps:

1. Find an issue you want to work on in the Sprint Backlog e.g. [2020E 3. Sprint](https://github.com/orgs/aau-giraf/projects/16) 
1. Ask the Process group if you can work on that issue
    - The Process group might say no for various reasons and they have the final say,
      as they have a better overview.
    - There is usually a greater chance of getting a yes, if the issue you have
      picked is either _highest_ or _high_ priority.

If you don't have a preferred issue you can ask the PO group to be assigned the
most pressing issue, as they have a good overview of the project and they will
most likely have some issues that they would like you to work with.

If a Development team need more issues to work on, they have to contact the Process
group.

## Code Review

As a developer in the GIRAF team you will have to review code made by other
developers. This should always be the main priority to further the development
process.  

## GitHub

The primary tool for the Development Phase is GitHub. The usage of GitHub in
GIRAF is described [here](../../../Development/GitHub/using_github.md).
