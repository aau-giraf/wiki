# Development Phase

The Development Phase starts after the Sprint Planning and ends on the day
of the Sprint Review.

## Work with Issues

In the Development Phase, the Development teams work with the issues they have
been given by the Process group after the Sprint Planning. 

If a Development team need more issues to work on, they have to contact the Process
group.

## Code Review

As a developer in the GIRAF team you will have to review code made by other
developers. This should always be the main priority to further the development
process.  

## GitHub

The primary tool for the Development Phase is GitHub. The usage of GitHub in
GIRAF is described [here](../../../Development/GitHub/using_github.md).
