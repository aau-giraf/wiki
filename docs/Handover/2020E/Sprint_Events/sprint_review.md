# Sprint Review

At the end of each sprint, there will a meeting, where all teams meet in one room
to discuss all issues from the finished sprint.

## Expected Duration

**Max** 2 hours (Adjusted for 2 week sprint).

## Result

All GIRAF team members get an overview of the issues that has been worked on
during the sprint.

## Before the Sprint Review

The **Process group** books a room for this meeting, and informs everyone about
it through the Slack channel **projekt-opdateringer** and then makes the event on
the Google Calendar.

The **PO group** prepares the next sprint goal and an overview of the Product
Backlog.

Every **Development team**, checks their issues and prepares some notes which
includes the following:

For every issue, that is defined as closed:

- Describe the solution.
    - Code can be shown to help explain the solution.
    - If the issue was closed, without making any changes, explain the reason
      behind this.
- Describe the problems that were faced, and how it was solved.
- If a new feature is implemented, prepare to show it, if it makes sense.

If an issue is in the review process at the time of the Sprint Review, it will
be seen as done for the Sprint Review.

For every open issue:

- Has there been worked on the issue
