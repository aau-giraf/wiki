After this release some of the most essential features were implemented.
These were the features that were implemented:

* The user could add a new weekplan
* The user could add an activity to a weekplan
* The user could move an activity from one day to another
* The user could press on an activity to see details about the activity
* The user could mark an activity as done
* The user was prompted with a dialog box that required him to type in his password when he wanted to change from citizen to guardian mode

Even though the dialog box for switching between citizen and guardian mode, the modes themselves were not implemented yet. So the dialog box did not change the mode.
