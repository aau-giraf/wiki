# Ownership Transfer

This document will describe how the next generation of GIRAF developers can get ownership of the different services.

## GitHub

To get access to the GitHub repositories, an [owner](https://github.com/orgs/aau-giraf/people?query=role%3Aowner) of the previous GIRAF generation needs to add the new memmbers. Alternatively, a new owner can be added and then he can add all relevant members.

## GIRAF Passwords

All relevant passwords should be found in the password manager [KeePass](https://keepass.info/).
Contact Ulrik Nyman ([ulrik@cs.aau.dk](mailto:ulrik@cs.aau.dk)) to get access to the it. 

The manager works by loading a file (``Giraf_Logins.kdbx``) and using the master password. 

Remember to have the file available some place public (eg. Drive) so all members can access if they need to. 
Any changes made means that the file will have to be re-uploaded. 
We recommended that the process group manages the passwords and the file.

## Google Play Store
To access the app store use the following credentials.

Email: ``aaugiraf@gmail.com``

Password: see KeePass

## App Store

To access the app store use the following credentials.

Email: ``giraf@lists.aau.dk``

Password: see KeePass

## Server Access

The server-meta group must compile a list of student emails who needs sudo acess to the server. 
The list should be sent to [support@its.aau.dk](mailto:support.its.aau.dk) after Semester Coordinater Ulrik Nyman ([ulrik@cs.aau.dk](mailto:ulrik@cs.aau.dk)) has **approved** the list. 

[More information can be found here](https://aau-giraf.github.io/wiki/development/server_administration/ServerOwnership/#ownership-transfer)

### dockerhub

A current admin needs to add all the relevant people (server-meta) manually. 
Compile a list with the dockerhub usernames (all lowercase) and send it to ``kshn16@student.aau.dk`` or another relevant server-meta group member of GIRAF 2020.

### Portainer Access

Portainer allows the visualization of the structure for the docker images. 
It can be helpful to have an UI instead of working in a terminal. 
Note that you have to be on the AAU network or use the VPN to access it.

URL: ```192.38.56.151:9000```
