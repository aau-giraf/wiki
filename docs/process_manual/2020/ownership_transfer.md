## Server Access

The server-meta group must compile a list of student emails who needs sudo acess to the server. 
The list should be sent to [support@its.aau.dk](mailto:support.its.aau.dk) after Semester Coordinater Ulrik Nyman ([ulrik@cs.aau.dk](mailto:ulrik@cs.aau.dk)) has **approved** the list. 

[More information can be found here](https://aau-giraf.github.io/wiki/development/server_administration/ServerOwnership/#ownership-transfer)

### dockerhub

A current admin needs to add all the relevant persons (server-meta) manually. 
Compile a list with the dockerhub usernames (all lowercase) and send it *kshn16@student.aau.dk* or another relevant server-meta group member of GIRAF 2020.

### Portainer Access

Portainer allows the visualization of the docker images. 
It can be helpful to have an UI instead of working in a terminal. 
Note that you have to be on the AAU network or use the VPN to access it.
