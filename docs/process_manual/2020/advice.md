# Advice for Future Process Groups

This section will describe our views and experiences, and what we found out that worked. 
Previous advice can be found [here](../../getting_started/advice_for_future_giraf/process_advice.md).

## The Process in General

* The project is everyone's, the process and PO group does not have more authority than everyone else, just more responsibility.
* Take your time to understand the process and project and read the wiki. It is time well spent.
* Use the process exactly as we have described it on this wiki and then modify it to your liking. 
This is to avoid confusion about what to do.
* Use Gitflow, as described in the wiki.
* Be aware of the process changing and make an active decision about what to do.
* Use the tools provided on this wiki and improve them for yourselves and the next years.
* Use some time at the end of your project making it ready to hand off to the next year.

## Communication

* Use Discord or Slack as the communication medium. Use it to broadcast event start times and deadlines.
    * Have a channel dedicated to *announcements* to make sure it does not get lost in the general chat.
* Events should be held at a physical or remote location with all developers present.
    * Start the meeting with the agenda. Remind people what the purpose is. Do this **every** time.
    * Take short breaks between the different activities to keep the groups focused.
    * If you do activities in smaller groups eg. Retrospective, remember to keep the groups small (<8) if you can. 
    This prevents people from hiding behind others who speaks the entire time.
* Keep things transparent. Files should be public and so should the thoughts behind process changes.
* Respond to questions in timely manner. Do not be condescending or hostile in your answers. 
    * You need to repeat a lot of information because people will forget or be confused. 
* Always be clear on what you say. Do not expect people to understand you implicitly. 
* Discuss the responsibilites of the process and PO group with the other developers at the start of the project.
    * Maybe try discussing the responsibilites before choosing who is process and PO group.

## Keeping an Overview

* Create a calendar available for all the groups in the project. Fill the calendar with all dates and times planned from the start.
* Decide where all your documents should be stored and be sure to be transparent with the other developer teams with the documents.
* Find an effective way to monitor and handle pull requests and reviews. We used Google Sheets and GitHub's API to automate it. 
* Clean up branches after every sprint. Delete those that weren't deleted when merging and make sure every branch has a purpose. 
* Decide if you want META-groups, which are groups focused on different aspects of the project such as front-end, back-end, server, and security.
