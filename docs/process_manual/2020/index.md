# Introduction

The following will describe the process used in the 2020 GIRAF project.

It contains:

* [Advice](advice.md): Advice to take into consideration before starting the project.
* [Giraf Events](giraf_events.md): What events we hold, how and why.
* [Git and Github](github.md): How to use GitHub correctly for GIRAF.
* [Ownership Transfer](ownership_transfer.md): How to gain access to the different platforms used.

We have tried to keep it as concise as possible.
All the sections are relevant for everyone involved in the project, as every individual should be aware of the processes.
