@aau-giraf/team you have been assigned this. Here's your checklist. I marked @user as the reviewer, but you might change it as you like.

Please use the following checklist:

**Code Documentation Only**

- [ ] Is there documented which BLoCs/Screens the current class is related to?
- [ ] Is the responsibility/functionality of the current class explained? Also regarding the classes it is related to?
- [ ] If any unusual decisions are introduced in the code are they reasoned about in the documentation?
 
**Wiki Related**

- [ ] Are there any dead links or references?
- [ ] Does the markdown render correctly in MkDocs?
- [ ] Is the content placed in the correct page/folder/section?

You can run MkDocs locally by following [this guide](../../writing_wiki.md#running-locally)
