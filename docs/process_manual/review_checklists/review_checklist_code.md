@aau-giraf/team you have been assigned this. Here's your checklist.
Please use the following checklist. Feel free to check it off as you go along.

**Code Design**

- [ ] The code is in the right place? (Both in terms of folder structure and class structure)
- [ ] This code could not, to the best of my knowledge, have reused existing code
- [ ] The code is not over-engineered. Examples of over-engineering: Implemented behavior for future problems
- [ ] The code does it introduce functionality that is not necessary for solving the problem

**Code Readability and Maintainability**

- [ ] Names are meaningful and self-documenting
- [ ] It is understandable, by reading the code, what it does
- [ ] The code is simple and readable. i.e. it contains no "hack", or obscure solution
- [ ] All new functionality is covered by tests
- [ ] It is understandable, by reading the tests, what they do
- [ ] The tests covers sensible cases. Both happy paths and exception paths
- [ ] The tests cover the full functionality. i.e., The tests fails if some of the requested functionality is missing
- [ ] Error messages in the code are understandable
- [ ] Confusing sections of code are covered by comments

**Functionality**

For this part, open the app, and test:

- [ ] The features that the code claims to implement, are actually implemented
- [ ] The code does not look like it has bugs
- [ ] All the new screens are reachable through in-app navigation

**Points for Discussion and Reflection**

- [ ] UI messages, that the user might meet, are actually helpful
- [ ] There are no errors that are bad practice. E.g. hard-coding a test database connection
- [ ] There is well written code in this. Remember to tell the developer!
