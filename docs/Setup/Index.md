# Environment Setup

The weekplanner setup depends on you having the two main Git repositories: [weekplanner](https://github.com/aau-giraf/weekplanner) and [web-api](https://github.com/aau-giraf/web-api) â€“ in order to get these repositories, you need to have installed Git locally. See this [guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) if you don't have it already (if you're on Mac, Git is installed during the installation guide).

To clone each of these repositories, create a directory, where you want your files to be kept. Be mindful of **not** storing the project in Dropbox, Google Drive or similar, as it might introduce unwanted behaviour, especially with file permissions etc., which isn't fun to debug.

Then open the terminal of your choice (e.g. Terminal, iTerm, PowerShell etc.), and clone the repositories into the directory by running:

`git clone git@github.com:aau-giraf/weekplanner.git`

and

`git clone git@github.com:aau-giraf/web-api.git`

when you have done this, proceed to the setup guide for your operating system, which you can find in the sidebar.
