# About

Giraf is a umbrella term for digital tools developed for autistic children with little or no verbal communication. 


The Giraf applications have been developed by students at Aalborg University as a semester project on the software engineering
education from the spring of 2011. 
The applications are created in close cooperation with [BÃ¸rnehaven Birken (Kindergarten)](http://bhbirken.dk/),
[Egebakken (School)](https://egebakken.aula.dk/) and [Center for Autism and ADHD](https://handicaptilbuddene.aalborg.dk/fagcentre/fagcenter-for-autisme-og-adhd)
at Aalborg Municipality.
