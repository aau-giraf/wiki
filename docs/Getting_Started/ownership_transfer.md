# Ownership Transfer

This document describes how the next generation of GIRAF developers can get
ownership of the different services.

## GIRAF Passwords

All relevant passwords can be found with the password manager [KeePass](https://keepass.info/).
Contact Ulrik Nyman ([ulrik@cs.aau.dk](mailto:ulrik@cs.aau.dk)) to get the `.kbdx` file containing the passwords. 

Remember to have the file available some place public (eg. Google Drive) so all members
can get access if they need to. 
Any changes made means that the file will have to be re-uploaded. 
We recommend that the Process group manages the passwords and the file.

## GitHub

To get access to the [GitHub](https://github.com/aau-giraf) repositories, an
owner needs to add the new members. 
Use the following credentials to login and add all the relevant members.

Username: `giraf@lists.aau.dk`

Password: see [KeePass](#giraf-passwords)

The account uses 2FA, so Ulrik Nyman ([ulrik@cs.aau.dk](mailto:ulrik@cs.aau.dk))
has to be contacted in order to get the secondary code.

## Google Play Store

To access the Google Play Store use the following credentials.

Email: `aaugiraf@gmail.com`

Password: see [KeePass](#giraf-passwords)

## App Store

To access the App Store use the following credentials.

Email: `giraf@lists.aau.dk`

Password: see [KeePass](#giraf-passwords)

## Google Drive (OUTDATED - left for inspiration)

To access the Google Drive use the same credentials as for the [Google Play Store](#google-play-store).

Email: `aaugiraf@gmail.com`

Password: see [KeePass](#giraf-passwords)

The Drive contains assets from past GIRAF teams. 
Among these assets are the tools and code review checklists used during the semester of 2020E.

## Server Access

As of today (02/09/2025) there is no GIRAF Server running. Previous semesters have run their own servers using [AAU Strato](https://hpc.aau.dk/strato/) 

### Portainer Access (OUTDATED - left for inspiration)

Portainer allows the visualization of the structure for the docker images. 
It can be helpful to have an UI instead of working in a terminal. 
Note that you have to be on the AAU network or use the AAU VPN to access it.

URL: `192.38.56.151:9000`

Username: `admin`

Password: see [KeePass](#giraf-passwords)
