# Pictogram files

As of May 2019, the [web-api](https://github.com/aau-giraf/web-api) has no pictograms
 stored in the repository.
Some pictograms have been stored in the [DBInitializer](https://github.com/aau-giraf/web-api/blob/develop/GirafRest/Data/DBInitializer.cs)
 class but have since been removed, because storing images in a database is generally
considered harmful.

As there no longer are any pictograms stored in the repository, it can be difficult
 to run a local version of the `web-api`.
We have therefore created a script which generates sample pictograms.
This script is found in [/scripts/pictogen.py](https://github.com/aau-giraf/web-api/blob/develop/scripts/pictogen.py).
The point of this script is to generate lots of pictograms and put them in the location
 where the `web-api` would normally look for them.

## Prerequisites

To run the script, we first need to ensure that we have Python 3, and Pillow (an
 image manipulation library).
We found that the easiest way to install Pillow, is through PIP which can be installed
 using the following links:

- [macOS](https://evansdianga.com/install-pip-osx/)
- [Windows](https://vgkits.org/blog/pip3-windows-howto/)
- Ubuntu run `sudo apt install python3-pip`.

Afterward, run:

```bash
pip install Pillow
```

You can verify the installation by first running `python3`, and then running `import
 PIL`.
If no errors occur, you are ready and set.

## Using

The script takes two arguments, the number of pictograms to generate, and where
to store them. Running the following command from the root of the `web-api` repository,
 should generate 200 pictograms and put them in the pictograms folder.

```bash
python3 scripts/pictogen.py 200 pictograms
```

As of May 13 of 2019, there are 104 pictograms generated by the [DBInitializer](https://github.com/aau-giraf/web-api/blob/develop/GirafRest/Data/DBInitializer.cs),
 generating 200 should be plenty.

## Recommendations

It might be beneficial for the future semesters to integrate this script into the
project as C\# code, which could be run with `dotnet run --sample-data`.
We did not have time to implement it with the above mentioned command. Implementing
it with C\# gives the added benefit, of not requiring users to have Python, PIP,
and Pillow installed.
