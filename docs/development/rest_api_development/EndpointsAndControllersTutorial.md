# Endpoints and Controllers Tutorial
This tutorial is created to help developers understand and create new controllers and endpoints in the Giraf project.

An endpoint is basically the end of a communication channel.
It is this point the API uses to access resources needed to fulfill a request.

A controller is a collection of endpoints.
Each controller is responsible for a limited area of the server/API and contains the endpoints related to said area.
