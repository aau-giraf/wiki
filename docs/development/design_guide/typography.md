# Typography
All text in the system should be consistent in terms of font, sizes and colors.

## Text colors
All text should by default be black (see colors section of the design guide).
In case the text refers to an inactive element, the grey text color should be used.

## Font family
The font should always be the [Quicksand font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Quicksand), as the customers prefer that the font is similar to how the citizens learn to write, especially in relation to the letter a.

## Font size
The font size should differ, depending on whether the application is in portrait or landscape mode.
In portrait mode, the text should be 30 pt, and in landscape it should be 20 pt.
Additionally, the package [auto_size_text](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/auto_size_text) should be used to ensure that the text fits within its area.

## Bold, italic and underlined text
The text should never be bold, italic or underlined in order to maintain a consistent design.
