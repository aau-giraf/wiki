# Consent Information

## Overview

The purpose of this document, is to detail two subjects mentioned in the
[GDPR Regulation](./gdpr_regulation.md) document, namely the Legal Processing and
the Legal Rights of the Data Subject. The essence of these two subject, are that
in order to process personal information of the data subject, there has to be lawful
basis for doing so, such as the establishment of a consent contract, and also that
the data subject has to be informed  of its legal rights. Both of these are required
to be fulfilled prior to committing personal information to the system, and therefore
it is optimal to ensure that both of these are ensured at the same time, such as
during sign-up.

## Requirements and maintenance

These requirements can be fulfilled by means of a consent-contract, with information about:

- Contact information about the data-controller
- Purpose of processing personal information
- Categories of personal information
- How personal information is retrieved
- How long person information is contained in the system and how it is deleted
- General rights of the data-subject

This document is based on a [template](https://www.datatilsynet.dk/media/6567/fortegnelse.pdf)
provided by Datatilsynet, with intention of being visible to the data-subject at
any time. This is also the reason why it is provided in Danish, such that it can
be integrated as part of the application.

The consent contract should be continuously maintained, which means updating it given
any changes to the processing of personal information, which would also require
a new acceptance of the consent contract from the data-subject. The changes that
would trigger an update, are equivalent to those described in the document
[Processing Activity Record Information](./processing_activity_record_information.md).

## The consent document

The consent-contract is provided as a separate [document](./consent.md).
