# Documentation of activity_bloc.dart

This file serves to document the `activity_bloc.dart` file from the weekplaner project.

## Functionality

The activity bloc is responsible for handling all the functionality that activities have.
Activities are the things which citizens have to do according to their week plan.

## Code

The `Load` function is used when accessing a week plan and all the activities need
to be loaded.

The `Complete activity` and `Cancel activity` functions both change the state of
an activity. They change it to completed and canceled respectively.

The `Update` function is called at the end of all functions that change the state
of an activity. The function then updates the weekmodel such that the new states
are represented correctly when looking at the week plan.
