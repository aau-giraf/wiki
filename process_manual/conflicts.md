# Conflicts

Conflicts will inevitably arise in the multi project. We will use the
following structure for fixing the potential problems.  
If the members of a group are disagreeing on a certain topic, the group
should make a decision by majority rule. If there is no majority, the
disagreeing parts should simply find a solution. Flip a coin, or rock,
paper, scissors.

> Remember if there is no majority rule, the options are probably
    equally sensible. In a large project like this a quick solution to
    conflicts is also a good solution to conflicts.

The development groups will handle internal conflicts as group conflicts
are usually handled: if needed use your supervisor.
