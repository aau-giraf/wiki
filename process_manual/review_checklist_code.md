@aau-giraf/team you have been assigned this. Here's your checklist. I marked @user as the reviewer, but you might change it as you like.
Please use the following checklist. Feel free to check it off as you go along.

**Code Design**
- [ ] Is the code in the right place? (Both in terms of folder structure and class structure)
- [ ] Could this code, to the best of your knowledge, have reused existing code?
- [ ] Is the code over-engineered? Examples of over-engineering: Implemented behavior for future problems
- [ ] Does it introduce functionality that is not necessary for solving the problem?

**Code Readability and Maintainability**
- [ ] Are names meaningful and self-documenting?
- [ ] Is it understandable, by reading the code, what it does?
- [ ] Is the code simple and readable? i.e. it contains no “hack”, or obscure solution.
- [ ] Is it understandable, by reading the tests, what they do?
- [ ] Do the tests cover sensible cases? Both happy paths and exception paths?
- [ ] Do the tests cover the full functionality? i.e., will the tests fail if some of the requested functionality is missing?
- [ ] Are error messages in the code understandable?
- [ ] Are confusing sections of code covered by comments?

**Functionality**
For this part, open the app, and test:
- [ ] Are the features that the code claims to implement, actually implemented?
- [ ] Does it look like the code has bugs?
- [ ] Are all new screens reachable through in-app navigation?

**Points for Discussion and Reflection**
- [ ] Are UI messages, that the user might meet, actually helpful?
- [ ] Are there errors that are bad practice? Like, hard-coding a test database connection?
- [ ] Is there well written code in this? Remember to tell the developer!
