@aau-giraf/team you have been assigned this. Here's your checklist. I marked @user as the reviewer, but you might change it as you like.
Please use the following checklist:
- [ ] Is there documented which BLoCs/Screens the current class is related to?

- [ ] Is the responsibility/functionality of the current class explained? Also regarding the classes it is related to?

- [ ] If any unusual decisions are introduced in the code are they reasoned about in the documentation?
