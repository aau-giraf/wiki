# choose_citizen_screen documentation
This file documents the choose_citizen_screen.dart file.

## Functionality
The choose_citizen_screen is the screen in the Week Planner App that shows the citizens associated with the guardian that is currently logged in. This screen is the first screen that is shown when a guardian logs on to the app.

## Layout of the screen

The blue square is the headline "VÃ¦lg borger". It helps the user figure out what they are supposed to do when they are in that screen.

The log out button (marked by a red circle) leads the user back to the log in screen. We want most screens to have log out buttons, so that if a guardian needs to hand the tablet to another guardian, then the other guardian can logout and log back in from anywhere in the system.
