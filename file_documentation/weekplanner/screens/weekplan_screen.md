## What is the screen used for?
The screen is the one responsible for showing all the days of the week. The screen each day in the weekplan_screen is displayed with all the planned activities for that single day. The colors of the
days are a standard to help autistic children. From the Weekplan screen different functionality can be accessed. The user mode can be changed, this happens by tapping INDSÆT ET BILLEDE,  

The weekplan screen is also able to display the activies marked as done or as cancelled. BILLEDE

By longpressing an activity you are able to move its placement both in the same day or move it to other days.




##How is the screen built
Each day is a column with a ListView, the ListView is 
scrollable. Thus when enough activities are added to a day. You can scroll (finger upwards) to see
the next activies. The activities are added by pushing the button with a plus button, located at the
bottom of the column. The button for add activity are located inside the day column but outside of the listview and thus they don't follow the scrolling.<br>
